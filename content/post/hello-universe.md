Evidence based medicine has been corrupted by corporate interests, failed regulation, and commercialisation of academia, argue these authors

The advent of evidence based medicine was a paradigm shift intended to provide a solid scientific foundation for medicine. The validity of this new paradigm, however, depends on reliable data from clinical trials, most of which are conducted by the pharmaceutical industry and reported in the names of senior academics. The release into the public domain of previously confidential pharmaceutical industry documents has given the medical community valuable insight into the degree to which industry sponsored clinical trials are misrepresented.[1](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o702#ref-1)[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o702#ref-2)[3](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o702#ref-3)[4](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o702#ref-4) Until this problem is corrected, evidence based medicine will remain an illusion.
